# Resume Hosting Application 

The purpose of this static web app is to provide a place to host my resume and other professional information. 

This Website is hosted in the AWS Cloud Platform using the S3 service. This is a breakdown of the architecture behind the website:

The architecture behind this website is able to remain very simple because of the hosting options provided by Amazon. If you would like to create a resume hosting site of your own please reference the following documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html and feel free to reach out regarding any questions! 

The source code for this project was based on HTML5 UP Divison, I have customized it to fit my purposes. There are a lot of improvements still to come such as explanding the architecture so multiple profiles can be hosted in one directory.
