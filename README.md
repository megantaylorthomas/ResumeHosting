The infrastructure behind this website is able to remain very simple due to the static nature of the website and the hosting options provided by Amazon. If you would like to create a resume hosting site of your own please reference the following documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html and feel free to reach out regarding any questions! 

The source code for this project was based on HTML5 UP Divison, I have customized it to fit my purposes. There are a lot of improvements still to come such as updating the code so multiple profiles can be hosted in one directory.
